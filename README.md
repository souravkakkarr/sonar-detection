# 🌊 **SONAR Detection of Rocks and Mines**

Dive into the depths with our SONAR Detection of Rocks and Mines project! 🚀 This project harnesses machine learning to distinguish between underwater rocks and mines using SONAR technology.

## Key Highlights 🛠️
- **Dataset Insight:** Utilized a dataset with 111 patterns from metal cylinders and 97 patterns from rocks, mimicking real-world underwater conditions.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implemented Logistic Regression for training, achieving an impressive 83% accuracy on the training dataset and 76% on the test dataset.
- **Real-world Application:** Enhance underwater security and exploration capabilities with accurate detection of submerged objects.

## Technologies Used 🖥️
- **Python:** Leveraged Python for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- **Scikit-learn:** Applied Scikit-learn for implementing the Logistic Regression model and evaluating its performance.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Explored and documented data insights and model development processes in interactive notebooks.
